# Sum-Of-Four-Squares
This is a program which implements an algorithm that caclulates how one can express any positive interger as the sum of the squares of four other numbers. 
Only certain numbers can be expressed as the sum of 2 or 3 squares but any number can be expressed as the sum of 4 squares and although the proof of this fact is not directly constrcutive as we have criteria for when a number can be expressed as the sum of 2 or 3 squares it permits us to develop algorthims whith which to find them.
